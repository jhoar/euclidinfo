<p>Euclid is an ESA mission that will fly an extremely sophisticated space telescope to measure the shapes of more than a billion galaxies, and accurate redshifts of tens of millions of galaxies.</p>

<p>The data are used to determine the expansion of the universe and the evolution of cosmic structures during the past 10 billion years of cosmic history with an unprecedented accuracy.</p>

<p>This will allow astronomers to map the geometry of the Universe and better understand the mysterious dark matter and dark energy, which are the principal components of the Universe.</p>

<p>The Euclid space mission puts Europe in a leading position to address these most fascinating of cosmological questions. And since the identity of the dark energy responsible for the acceleration is entirely mysterious, Euclid's answers could revolutionise physics.</p>
