<p>The Euclid mission will produce three major data releases during its nominal lifetime. Each release contains data products derived from an increasingly large sky area from the Euclid Survey. Smaller releases of data will be made with specialised subsets of data products. These data releases will be accompanied by the major scientitific results from the mission reflecting the quest to understand the mysteries of dark energy and dark manner.<p>
