<p>Euclid will orbit the second Lagrange point (L2), 1.5 million kilometres from Earth in the opposite direction from the Sun. L2 is an equilibrium point of the Sun-Earth system that follows the Earth around the Sun. In its orbit at L2, Euclid’s sunshield can always block the light from the Sun, Earth and Moon while pointing its telescope towards deep space, ensuring a high level of stability for its instruments.</p>
