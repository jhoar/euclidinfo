<p>An unknown ‘dark energy’ appears to drive the current accelerated expansion of our Universe, but scientists do not understand how and why. Euclid will map the last 10 billion years of cosmic history across more than a third of the sky – from cosmic ‘noon’, the time when most stars were forming, until today. This 'looking back in time' will show us the variations in the cosmic acceleration with extreme precision, revealing the nature of dark energy in this process.</p>
