<p>Euclid is designed to provide both excellent quality imaging in the visible, and spectroscopy and photometry in the near-infrared. The sunshield keeps the telescopes and instruments shaded from the Sun to ensure thermal stability and highly sensitive measurements. It will make sure VIS operates at -33 °C and NISP at -180 °C. To store the large data volume that will be accumulated during observations, Euclid has a mass memory of 4 terabits.</p>
<p>Euclid's mass in orbit will be 2 tonnes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>800 kg payload module</li>
    <li>850 kg service module</li>
    <li>40 kg balancing mass</li>
    <li>210 kg propellant</li>
</ul>
