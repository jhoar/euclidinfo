<p>Euclid is an ESA mission. It launches on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, USA. Its destination is Sun-Earth Lagrange point 2, 1.5 million km from Earth. Euclid carries two science instruments</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 visible-wavelength camera (VIS)</li>
    <li>1 near-infrared photometer and spectrometer (NISP)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Euclid Consortium has delivered to ESA the VIS and NISP instruments. NASA provided the near-infrared detectors of NISP. Euclid will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Observe 1/3 of the sky</li>
    <li>Measure the shape, position and distance of galaxies out to 10 billion light-years</li>
    <li>Create the largest, most accurate 3D map of the Universe ever produced</li>
</ul>
<p>Euclid will address two core themes of ESA's Cosmic Vision 2015-2025:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What are the fundamental physical laws of the Universe?</li>
    <li>How did the Universe originate and what is it made of?</li>
</ul>
